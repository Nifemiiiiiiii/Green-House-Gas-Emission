# Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis: Understanding Environmental Impact Across Industries

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36cd15c0-7465-4c89-a16c-2a5b69aafa8d)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across various industries in the supply chain, identifying key contributors to carbon footprints and providing insights into sustainable practices. The analysis helps stakeholders assess emission trends, regulatory compliance, and opportunities for emission reduction strategies.

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains information on supply chain emissions, including:

Company ID
Industry Sector
GHG Emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3)
Energy Consumption (Renewable vs. Non-Renewable)
Production Volume
Revenue
Carbon Intensity per Unit of Production
Emission Reduction Initiatives (Yes/No)


## Data Quality / Data Cleaning Preparation Assessments
* Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing GHG emissions data using median values for respective industries.
* Data Type Corrections: Converted numeric fields (GHG emissions, energy consumption) to appropriate formats.
* Duplicate Removal: Eliminated duplicate records.
* Outlier Detection: Removed extreme anomalies in emission values using IQR-based filtering.
* Categorical Standardization: Ensured consistency in industry sector labels.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consists of:

1. Industry-Wise Emissions Breakdown: Total emissions per industry sector.
2. Scope 1, 2, and 3 Emissions Overview: Contribution of direct and indirect emissions.
3. Company-Level Sustainability Efforts: Proportion of companies implementing emission reduction strategies.

## Analysis and Visualizations



## Insights and Recommendations
Manufacturing and transportation are the highest emission contributors, requiring stricter sustainability regulations and carbon offset programs.
Scope 3 emissions dominate supply chain footprints, highlighting the need for collaborative emission reduction efforts with suppliers.
Renewable energy adoption remains low, presenting an opportunity for businesses to invest in cleaner energy sources.
Industries with high carbon intensity should focus on energy efficiency and alternative production methods.
Companies implementing emission reduction initiatives see tangible benefits, suggesting that financial incentives should be introduced for sustainability programs.
Carbon pricing mechanisms can encourage industries to adopt greener practices, leading to long-term sustainability.
Conclusions
✅ Manufacturing and transportation sectors require urgent emission control measures.
✅ Scope 3 emissions need stronger supplier engagement for reduction.
✅ Renewable energy adoption must be prioritized in supply chain operations.
✅ High-carbon industries should implement stricter efficiency measures.
✅ Sustainability initiatives significantly reduce carbon intensity.
✅ Financial incentives and regulations can accelerate decarbonization efforts.
