# Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis: Understanding Environmental Impact Across Industries

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36cd15c0-7465-4c89-a16c-2a5b69aafa8d)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across various industries in the supply chain, identifying key contributors to carbon footprints and providing insights into sustainable practices. The analysis helps stakeholders assess emission trends, regulatory compliance, and opportunities for emission reduction strategies.

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains information on supply chain emissions, including:

* 2017 NAICS Code
* 2017 NAICS Title
* Reference code
* GHG
* Unit
* Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins
* Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors
* Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins
* Reference USEEIO Code
* Reference USEEIO Attribute

## Data Quality / Data Cleaning Preparation Assessments
* Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing GHG emissions data using median values for respective industries.
* Data Type Corrections: Converted numeric fields (GHG emissions, energy consumption) to appropriate formats.
* Duplicate Removal: Eliminated duplicate records.
* Outlier Detection: Removed extreme anomalies in emission values using IQR-based filtering.
* Categorical Standardization: Ensured consistency in industry sector labels.

## Dashboard Overview
The dashboard consists of:

1. Industry-Wise Emissions Breakdown: Total emissions per industry sector.
2. Scope 1, 2, and 3 Emissions Overview: Contribution of direct and indirect emissions.
3. Company-Level Sustainability Efforts: Proportion of companies implementing emission reduction strategies.

## Analysis and Visualizations

### Projected Emission overtime

Here's a projected emission graph from 2024=2030. this trend shows a gradual decline in emission which is encouraging. However, industries need to ensiure the continue adoption of of sustainable practice to meet or exceed this projection

### Top Industry

The top industry contributing to to emission the commercial & Institutional building construction, which acts as 1% of the total emission

### Effieciency

Measures for 3.70 which indicates the balance between economic values and emission. 

## Insights and Recommendations
* Speciality trade contractor, Drywall insulator contractor and electrical conductors and other wirings are the highest emission contributors, requiring stricter sustainability regulations and carbon offset programs.
* The need for collaborative emission reduction efforts with suppliers.
* Renewable energy adoption remains low, presenting an opportunity for businesses to invest in cleaner energy sources.
* Industries with high carbon intensity should focus on energy efficiency and alternative production methods.
* Companies implementing emission reduction initiatives see tangible benefits, suggesting that financial incentives should be introduced for sustainability programs.
* Carbon pricing mechanisms can encourage industries to adopt greener practices, leading to long-term sustainability.

## Conclusions

1. Manufacturing and transportation sectors require urgent emission control measures.
2. Scope 3 emissions need stronger supplier engagement for reduction.
3. Renewable energy adoption must be prioritized in supply chain operations.
4. High-carbon industries should implement stricter efficiency measures.
5. Sustainability initiatives significantly reduce carbon intensity.
6. Financial incentives and regulations can accelerate decarbonization efforts.
